# git_html_css_javascript_timed_quiz

## Description

The goal was to make a fully functioning timed quiz that shows, stores, and can call back scores obtained from completing the quiz. I used Html and Css to provide the basic framework of the quiz. Html properties such as basic semantic, classes, and ID's were used while css properties like margins, paddings, and display properties were used. Javascript allowed me to create a timer that counts down after the start button is clicked, to dislay different pages of the quiz based on events that happen in the website, and display the users score on completion of the quiz or if the timer reached 0. Functions, event listeners, intervals, if and else statements, local storage, etc. were all used in order to complete these requirements.

These links helped me do various things within the website such as absolute vs relative positioning, add the same event listener for multiple buttons, use flex properties to display in the center, send items into local storage, determine which input type I wanted, and finally clear the array within the local storage.

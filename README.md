# git_html_css_javascript_timed_quiz

## Description

I used Javascript to create functions, display prompts/confirms, and to use a for loop with if statements contained within it. The functions allowed me to randomly select uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The prompt allowed a length of specified value to be created. The confirms created boolean values for the if statements to check. The for loop allowed me to repeat the process of checking the if statements until a satisfactory password length was obtained. The if statements within the for loop called upon the functions that selected the characters and placed them within the generated password. 

The goal was to make a fully functioning randomized password generator that displayed prompts when the generate password button was clicked. This result was obtained through the process above.

These links helped me do various things within the website such as absolute vs relative positioning, add the same event listener for multiple buttons, use flex properties to display in the center, send items into local storage, determine which input type I wanted, and finally clear the array within the local storage.
